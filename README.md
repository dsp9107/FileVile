purpose ?

to eliminate the hassle of maintaining and keeping track of student's lab files + getting them prepped for print

goals ?

Iteration 1

- have one common layout
- user has to provide data such as aim, code, output, etc.
- a document in .pdf would be generated out of that data and can be downloaded by the student

Iteration 2

- have formats for each subject separately
- custom header & footer ; uid, name, page no, etc.
- python code, if feasible and error-free, would be executed and output captured ; user no need to supply output screenshot

Iteration 3

- user can edit data online using markdown
- files would be stored as per subject, separately
- index can be uploaded and aims fetched out of it ; user no need to supply aim, just select from the options

scope
